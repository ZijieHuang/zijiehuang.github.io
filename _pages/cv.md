Work experience
======
* 2024 - present: **Senior Research Associate** in High Performance Network @[_Center for Sociodigital Futures, University of Bristol_](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/centres/sociodigital-futures/)
  * Duties includes:
    * Lead the “Environmental Impact of Future Networks” project, focusing on innovative sustainable future network technologies and their environmental impact on wider 6G roll-out scenarios and sociodigital futures.
    * Designed and developed comprehensive energy consumption models for UK nation-wide telecom network using static and dynamic modelling methodologies.
    * Developed energy-efficient AI solutions to reduce RAN and data centre energy consumption.
    * Led interdisciplinary teams in collaborations between academia (cross-faculties) and industry (BT, DTC Telcom), resulting in real-world implementations and demonstrations, and multiple research papers.
    * Collaborated with community organizations, policymakers and jury citizens to explore how the development of 6G is embedded in geopolitical tensions, and to facilitate conversations using speculative methods that inspire diverse communities to imagine, articulate, and reflect on their visions for the future of network technologies.
  * Line Manager: [Professor Rasheed Hussain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasheed-hussain-b7296123/) & [Professor Susan Halford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-halford-facss-frsa-46054028/)

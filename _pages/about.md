Hi, here is Zijie (黄子婕 in chinese), welcome to my homepage!
I am a Senior Research Associate in High Performance Network at Center for Sociodigital Future, University of Bristol. My research interests encompass the expansive field of trustworthy AI techniques. Specifically, my focus is on elevating the interpretability, fairness, and accountability of diverse machine learning models. This includes, but is not limited to, neural network, generative AI, and autonomous decision-making aligned with human values.
